# Lift Calculator

A Flutter app to use alongside the 5/3/1 routine from Jim Wendler. 

## Introduction

There is currently no free Android App available to keep track of the 5/3/1 routine - the only option follows a subscription model. 
Thus, I decided to build my own. 

This is my first project in Flutter, there are probably a lot of things that could be done more efficient or in a different way - this is my way of learning something new, while giving it a purpose in my day to day life. 

## Features
The features are mostly tied to my own usage / gym habits. Thus at the moment I only support 1 leader and 1 anchor template. (Boring But Big and FSL with Widowmakers)

- Calculate training plan for every lift/week according to the current cycle
- Stats tracking




### Dev-Notes
-  🐛 Fix navigation 
-  ✨ Add assistance class + templates - should be tied to current exercise
-  ✨ Add assistance to exercise
-  ✨ Cycle overview screen (needs design and everything)
  
- Intro screen on initial startup -- walk trough and TM input screen
